This document contains all unique feedback from CodeCanyon submission rejections merged into a single comprehensive list.

## All Reviewer Feedback Points

### Code Quality & Technical Issues
- Don't ship old libraries
- Old libraries are not allowed as they pose security issues. Especially jQuery. Older versions have an XSS issue
- Remove ALL unused code
- All JavaScript should be written with "use strict" mode on
- Use .on() rather than .click(), .bind(), .hover(), .submit() etc...
- No inline scripts or styles unless dynamic
- Remove pointless code
- Don't use @import, it prevents parallel downloads

### Asset Management
- Don't load assets from CDN
- Just make the items fit correctly. If you used retina images they could upscale and downscale as needed for each media query
- Fix broken images in demos
- Everything in a demo should work, including the broken images

### Content & Localization
- Ensure all strings are translatable
- Remove all trademarked content
- Content should not be hardcoded

### Demo & Authentication Issues
- Provide demo credentials for testing
- We require full access during the approval phase

### Testing & Functionality
- Fully test everything before resubmitting
- Installation issue
- Ensure there are no errors
- We keep getting random 419 errors but unable to capture them

### UI/UX Issues
- Styling is off here
- Looks incomplete
- Poor visual hierarchy
- This looks unfinished, unless I am missing something?
- Why is everything blank?
- Design cut off in responsive mode

### Documentation
- Docs are insufficient. Provide in-depth, step-by-step instructions on installation, setup and usage
- Where are the Docs?
- You should also include offline documentation
- Then you need to add this to your Docs

### Installation & Setup
- As the owner/admin/person who has performed the installation, redirect them to the admin panel, not here (poor UX)
- By the very definition of being the person who installs the application, it would assume you are the admin and should be redirected to the admin panel. General users are not installing the application
- Install goes to this instead of the proper website with admin?
- Remove default users

### Content Issues
- Check for typos
- "Description field is required" yet it's already populated from AI?
- Where are the applications?
- Where is the AI integration?
- Does this have a frontend?

### Project-Specific Issues
- Ensure everything is sufficiently different from your other item
- The item's description is very lacking, please add more information

### Screenshot & Media Requirements
- Please make sure your screenshot's resolution is complying with standards:
  - Portrait: from 700px to 900px high
  - Landscape: minimum resolution of 1280px x 720px (width x height) and aspect ratio of 16:9

### Version Control Issues
- If you're using Linux, how did .DS_Store get there? Some are still there
- Versions

- "Please go back through your previous review(s) and ensure ALL raised issues have been addressed before resubmitting."

### General Review Notes
- "Any screenshots provided are simply examples. There may be more issues that are similar. Ensure you check all files and fix all instances of each issue before resubmitting."
